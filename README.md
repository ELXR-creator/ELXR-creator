## Hi there 👋
# 🧠 Elxr Project Suite  
**Engineering. Intelligence. Precision.**

---

## 👋 Welcome to **Elxr**
Elxr is a **personal R&D and production ecosystem** built by **Piyush** — focused on creating intelligent systems that bridge data, automation, and software engineering.  

Each project in the suite represents a layer of evolution:  
from **learning** → **building** → **deploying** → **scaling**.
